State estimation is one of the most fundamental bases for a vast range of applications, specially in robotics and AI which is one of the most rapidly growing field. Augmented or virtual reality (AR/VR), autonomous driving, drone mapping and robotic navigation are a few of the applications using state estimation principles. The stereo camera setup still lacks in gathering the metric scale, which limits its usage in real work applications. But paring up the stereo camera with an inertial measurement unit IMU into a monocular visual inertial system (VINS) overrules the limitation and is capable of capturing metric scale along with roll and pitch data. The main aim of the project is to obtain a tool for autonomously or semi-autonomously constructing 3D maps of the complex underwater environment using the onboard sensors including spatial perception camera, IMU and laser sensors. This data is further analysed via VINS MONO for state estimation and map generation, which can further assist in monitoring coral reefs in sea, structural conditions in canals and so on. In the further sections the process of development of the physical system is explained. 

Two different arrangements were considered and tested. One which was successful was chosen for final test. The components, arrangement and explanation for each setup is explained in the next section. After that the sensors or camera used for this project are illustrated along with a brief explanation of the software setup used and the output data that is being generated which is required for further analysis. In the final part, analysis is shown using VINS ROS package and its outcomes are discussed. Output of the VINS package is shown in form of graphs and RVIZ representation. All of this is followed by the result an conclusion of the paper for using VINS in underwater scenario via a remotely operated vehicle setup.
